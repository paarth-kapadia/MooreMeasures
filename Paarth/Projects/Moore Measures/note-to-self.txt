What I did for input data files:

shasum *.csv > shasums.txt
wc -l *.csv > lines.txt
head -n 1 *.csv > headers.txt




Example of one thing I did for SQL files, to look for possible PHI signals:

perl -ne 'print if (/\d\d\d\d/ )' *.sql | less

That's only one example. I did other things, excluding match on 'Dflt' etc., to have more specific views. Why Perl? Because Perl was on the Git Bash terminal, that's why.
